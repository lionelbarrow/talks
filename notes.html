<h1>Why learn more langauges?</h1>

<h3>Why have this discussion?</h3>

<p>Often there is an implicit understanding among people of why this is a good idea, but let’s not take it for granted. want to be explicit</p>

<p>programing is a social act dramatically influenced by cultural practices of your group</p>

influences in the form of idioms, standards include toolchains, dependency management, but also coding style, both at the project level and at the level of source file

questions like: can i read the source code of a package?

3. when I sat down to learn ruby, someone told me to install a dependency manager, so I got this 20,000 line bash script that overwrites the cd command because it was the “ruby way”

1. can’t write more than one thing at a time

2. can’t generalize from a single example

3. “there’s a better way to do this”

4. critically important after learning a new language to go back and do more stuff in old language but make conscious effort to think about why you’re doing it that way
