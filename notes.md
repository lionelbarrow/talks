# Why learn more langauges?

### Why have this discussion?

Often there is an implicit understanding among people of why this is a good idea, but let’s not take it for granted. Want to be explicit.

### Programing is a social act dramatically influenced by cultural practices of your group.

Influences come in the form of idioms, standards include toolchains, dependency management, but also coding style, both at the project level and at the level of source file.

Cultural practices like: can I read the source code of a package?

### When I sat down to learn Ruby, someone told me to install a dependency manager, so I got this 20,000 line bash script that overwrites the cd command because it was the “Ruby way”

# "It makes you a better developer"

Well, you can’t write more than one thing at a time

Can’t generalize from a single example

Makes you realize there’s a better way to do things

Critically important after learning a new language to go back and do more stuff in old language but make conscious effort to think about why you’re doing it that way

# Go

# Go basics

Not true duck typing since compiler only knows that a value has the interface it was declared as having -- not any other interfaces it may implement
