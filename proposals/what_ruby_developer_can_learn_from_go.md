Go has rapidly built a reputation as a great language for web development. But
most of us already work in great languages  -- why should we be interested in
Go?

After using Go in a project at Braintree for the last four months, Iâ€™m
convinced that every web developer would benefit from exposure to the Go
approach to web development, which places a strong emphasis on up-front error
handling, modular libraries, and behavioral testing.

In this talk, we will:
  * Compare idiomatic approaches to common problems such as error handling,
  * dependency management and testing in Go and Ruby.
  * Think carefully about tradeoffs between different programming styles and
  * examine how programming languages encourage one style or another.
  * Tease out common ideas and best practices that apply to all web
  * applications, regardless of language or framework.
  * Read a bunch of code.

We will not:
  * Try to convince anyone to ditch Ruby/Python/whatever and embrace Go.
  * Make vague, unsubstantiated claims about the benefits of static or dynamic
  * typing.
  * Assume any prior knowledge of Go.
