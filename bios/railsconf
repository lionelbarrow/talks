Lionel Barrow (@lionelbarrow) is a developer at Braintree and a graduate
student in computer science at the University of Chicago. At Braintree, he
recently worked on Venmo Touch, once of the first highly available web
services to be written in Go. A born geek, he fell into programming when he
got sick of manually de-duplicating his college's admissions database. When
not coding, he blogs (in vim) and dabbles in machine learning.
